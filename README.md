#   US ACCIDENT DATA ANALYSIS.
The following project involves cleaning, analysing and exploring accident data to find out the major drivers of accidents within United States of America. The dataset has 42768 rows and  47 columns. 

## METHODOLOGY.
1. Importing the Data
2. Data Preprocessing
3. Data cleaning
4. Exploratory Data Analysis.

The dataset had a lot of missing values and I decided to drop them in order not to skew the data.

## FINDINGS.
After exploration, I found out that  weather, road conditions and ignorance are major causes for road accidents. Accidents were particularly common during humid conditions and if the visibility was low. Severity differed among different hotspots and weather conditions.

The following is a plot that shows the count of accidents per state, California had the majority of accidents likely due to it being alarge state, having major roads passing through it, raod conditions, congestion and ignorance.
